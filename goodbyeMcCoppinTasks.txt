List of things to finish before my last day on Jan 21, 2021

ranked by priority

- chainsaw and cut down all the escallonia to 2-3ft
- plant the big pine
- plant the Erigeron glaucus that i've propagated at south nursery at aeonium corner (adjacent to the Salvia mellifera). could also pepper some in at aboveshed
- clear the area with ehrharta and sheetmulch and plant agapanthus to line the back side of hebecorner and the path
- clear up the eucalyptus debris that i left with chainsaw
- clear up the monterey cypress debris that i left with chainsaw
- seed the hillside with annuals somehow so that the perennials get some support
- remulch little cypresses with yellow mulch so they stand out and don't get trampled
- edge perimeter one last time
- take care of crackweeds with a roundpoint or hook-hoe
- weed the athletic courts
- replace the Mcleod that i lost (sorry)
- aerate the slope hotspots
- cut down eucalyptus branch at circle (**might be wrong time to do this so maybe don't do it**)
- stop pulling nasturtium until my last day. then pull all nasturtium
- grab cuttings of everything i would need (Ajuga, Dymondia, Cerastium, Aeonium, etc)
