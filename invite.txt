my invitation for my hillside reveal

Hello
Welcome
I would like to invite you to the unveiling of my hillside project.
You are one of many people in the dept who have inspired me and/or taught me in some way, whether it was horticultural basics, or mental fortitude and perseverance, or thinking outside the box and finding creative solutions, or exploring new topics and finding my own motivations to continue learning and being inspired by the natural world and this career.
This project represents the conclusion of my first year as a 3417 gardener. It also is the result of the combined expertise and wisdom you have all imparted on me over the last few years, starting from when I was a volunteer at SFBG nursery, to a volunteer at SFBG, to an apprentice making my way through all your different sections, to a beginning gardener getting my footing at my first park, to now.
I would like to say thank you to everyone because I learned so, so much. It was not only from the advice and guidance you gave me, but also from observing how you approach your day-to-day and the constant efforts you make towards your own professional growth.

This project is about solving a problem (erosion, using organic matter to store water), creating more usable space (beautification), and working with nature (choosing appropriate species and hopefully fostering biodiversity). This project is also about experimentation and challenging the status quo. I used a lot of techniques that I learned through research and fellow colleagues (that I hope I have executed correctly), which I intend to build upon in future endeavors.
By attempting this, I want to demonstrate that, given a space, a person can go so much further than simply keeping it clean. After (baseline) tidiness has been achieved, something beautiful can be made, which can then become something educational and interesting. This is not the project's completion but rather its beginning.

Thank you. I hope you enjoy it.
