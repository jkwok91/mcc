McCoppin Sq
- Rainbow Montessori front bed

I. Research Analysis
	- Planning Objectives:
		- fill in an empty bed in front of Rainbow Montessori preschool
		- add color and interest and appeal via planting

II. Site Analysis
	- Located in Parkside (Sunset)
	- Front facade of the preschool, against a wall.
	- South-facing
	- Exposure: full sun
	- Irrigation present (currently popups)
	- Wind: none, bed is shielded by building
	- Pests: weeds only. no animal pests

III. Description
	- This bed measures 3' deep and 17'9" wide, with rounded (quarter-circle) corners
	- It is in front of a wall of the building that is blank except for a 2' sign that reads "Rainbow Montessori."
	- It is on the ground (not a raised bed).
	- There is a narrow path (30" wide) on one side of the bed, and on the other side is the entrance to the preschool.

IV. Users
	- This area is seen by all parents and children and employees of preschool. It is highly visible.

V. Development Concept
	- This area should be more visually appealing and call attention to the "Rainbow Montessori" sign.
	- Theme is "rainbow." Firstly, because that's the name of the school. Secondly, it is against a plain beige wall. Thirdly, because children like colors.
	- Rough planting idea/shape:
		- two tall (3-5') shrubs on either side
		- three short (1-3') shrubs in between, maybe with tall inflorescences for ephemeral interest
		- soft perennials/ground cover dispersed in the remaining space
		- definitely want some Asteraceae stuff in there because the inflorescence shape is familiar/approachable. but also definitely want some other type of inflorescence
		- definitely want as much color as possible. nothing short of color vomit.
		- probably stick to evergreen stuff. deadheading ok.

VI. Plant ideas
	- [RED AND TALL] - Salvia elegans
		- prefer the one with yellow-green foliage for more contrast between the foliage and red flowers, as well as the between the foliage and all other things. Also the bright yellow-green is mimicked by the nearby Pittosporum eugenioides hedges.
		- also chosen for its eventual height and lushness, as well as its fragrance, and soft (tomentose) foliage
		- could also do Salvia confertiflora because it's a cool shape that children might like.
	- [FINE TEXTURED AND BLUE]
		- options: Salvia chamaedryoides? Salvia nemerosa? Nepeta? Felicia amelloides
		- there's a nearby Salvia microphylla 'Hot Lips' with fine-textured foliage
		- this adds a blue flower to the bed
	- [SOFT/PERENNIAL AND YELLOW/ORANGE]
		- options: Achillea? Gallardia? Rudbeckia?
	- [WHITE]
		- options: shasta daisy?
