24 MARCH 2020 UPDATE:
	- Current ongoing projects:
		- area above my shed that wraps around to the back of the preschool
			- it is being sheet-mulched and planted with mostly natives. i sprinkled in some non-natives just to see how they would fare
		- 24th and Santiago entrance
			- it is being weeded of ivy/blackberry and sheet-mulched. i have not come up with any plants i want to put there yet and it is looking quite barren and I am a bit concerned.
		- Parkside Library
			- it is ready for planting except that i have not come up with a planting plan and also the irrigation is unknown. i will be installing drip irrigation.
		- 22nd and Santiago entrance
			- i have started some small plants here with mulch to assist in moisture retention and delineation and we will see how they do.
	- Finished projects (for now):
		- tiny bed in front of preschool.
			- progress report: Salvia elegans stayin alive amidst california poppies and icelandic poppies that have finished flowering. primula have died after their initial display. thank you for your service. goodbye now.
			- no further work is anticipated. there is a bit of ehrharta from time to time but it is minimal due to poppy filler, and occasional hand-weeding.
		- tiny bed next to my shed
			- progress report: cotyledon orbiculata are growing here with mulch. at the end of the bed is a hebe that i need to rip out or transplant (i should move it to 24/S) but haven't because. idk. procrastination? what am i doing. i need to get rid of this. plus oxalis and crocrosmia grow thru the hebe sometimes. maybe i will put salvia microphylla here to match the other one. or transplant one of those pittosporum eugenioides from the natural area (to match the other P.eugenioides). i have the resources.
		- station 13 and 14 lawn areas that i planted trees in
			- progress report: it seems that i failed to save one of the melaleuca leucadendra (my fault, i didn't water it enough) and it is real crispy-looking and i'm sure it is dead now. i will replace it the next time i go to nursery. also need to continue expanding the planting to phase out the lawn. also there's still a dead spot at the very bottom of the lawn where i put two arbutus, and i will put some ground cover and add mulch to help green it up.
	- Dump zones aka areas where i am waiting to see what happens and doing nothing in the way of tidying
		- behind tennis court.
			- lupines seeded themselves here and i have added a tiny transplant of a monterey cypress which i think is dying from gopher or lack of water? altho i thought i was watering it pretty well for a while... maybe it was gopher. ive killed that gopher now. but the cypress is dead. RIP. i've also put two myoporum parvifolium to see what they do. also the ceanothus i coppiced is coming back. i put some lupines there as well and an icelandic poppy that is actually growing and has bloomed. i hope this poppy will reseed. annuals are my solution to cover bare soil / be filler right now.
		- hugelkultur #1
			- ok so i started this hugelkultur attempt because i figured it was out of the way enough for me to do some test nonsense because it's on a hill and no one goes there. it was going well until weeds from the soil i got from the nursery started coming up. so. thanks a lot, nursery. i think i have to like, actively weed this until the lupines i put there get bigger. this is quite annoying. also i think i am going to transplant one of the baby pines i have. maybe that will do ok.
		- hugelkultur #2
			- this is the hillside behind 24/S entrance that overlooks the ballfield. i started this because i was lifting the monterey cypresses at 24/S entrance and i wanted to reuse them somehow and not have to take them off-site. unfortunately i wasn't super sure what the hell i was doing so i just stacked all the debris on this hillside. and i've been dumping clippings (well, cesar has been dumping clippings) on top of some logs and i also don't have a water source which is really annoying. so. ugh. i think station 39 can reach it actually. let me fiddle with that tomorrow.
		- natural areas (euc forest)
			- i dumped library soil in here. and bread from the person who throws bread. this is the dumping ground yo. all i do in this area in the way of maintenance is remove solanum. yo i don't wanna see any solanum in this park. also mallow once it exceeds 18" / if i see it flowering. NO MALLOW. it's an uphill battle for sure.
		- 22nd Ave towards Taraval (shed to truck entrance)
			- yeaaaaa i'm barely upkeeping this. miner's lettuce honestly is a blessing. it's retaining moisture and i see that the little oak and the douglas irises i put in the midst of it is very happy. i will not disturb. thank you Claytonia perfoliata. further down towards truck entrance there is a bunch of mallow and it's really fugly and i hate it. i will deal with this because it is starting to bug me. the two little oaks i put over here are still alive but not really exhibiting a whole lot of progress. i may give them a bucket of water once a week. or i could do wildflower seeds and impact sprinkler. we'll see. there's a gopher here that i haven't managed to kill.

covid quarantine is having a postive effect on my mental clarity. i am now able to make notes on what i needa do. that said, the biggest project of all is taraval (most visible) and i am actively avoiding thinking about that because it is very daunting.

		- When high school is in session there is a continuous stream of students

II. Notes, which I will take when I am on-site
	A. Questions for myself
		- Users:
			- Who are the residential park patrons?
				- mostly older asian people taking walks. Older asian people really like walking.
				- some younger folks playing tennis in the tennis court
				- some dog walkers (all dogs were on leash!!! Yay. thank you)
			- How many high school kids come through?
				- many
			- Who eats their lunch or takes break here (employees)?
				- high school kids eat in the tennis court. no employees eat here.
			- Are there a lot of dogs?
				- some
			- Are there a lot of children?
				- so far, only a few, in the CPA
			- How often are the various facilities used (athletic fields and courts)?
				- daily
			- Where is the available seating? What is the view from sitting there?
				- seating is quite limited. the views are bad or boring.
			- Where do the paths go / what is seen from the paths / what is the mood (if any (is it a boring path or is it cool/exploration-encouraging/scary))?
				- paths are boring
		- Horticulture:
			- What are the conditions / what different areas are there in this park?
				- see next section
			- What sorts of plants are here?
				- a single cistus species, a single ceanothus species, ehrharta, arbutus, eucalyptus, monterey cypress, acacia melanoxylon + infinite suckers, plantain in the turf, a few ginkgo, a weird grisellinia hedge that serves no purpose???
			- Are any plants suffering?
				- windblown
			- Are any plants implying maintenance difficulty?
				- there are three monterey cypress planted very close together in a raised bed and i don't know why
			- Are there a lot of weeds / can I install ground cover for weed suppression
				- ehrharta in all beds
				- not anticipating gc as a solution for these beds which are already filled with ceanothus
		- Maintenance:
			- Where is the backflow? Where are the valves?
				- backflow is in the middle of santiago.
			- What is the irrigation (rotors, popups, drip, none)?
				- a horribly messy mix of all
			- Are there any brown spots (hard to see now that it's rainy season) / muddy spots / compacted soil?
			- Ask Brandon: when was aeration last done?
			- Are there ornamental lawns and if so why and also make a note so in the future I can replace with more water-efficient plantings
				- everywhere.
			- What do the entrances look like? How many are there? Are they inviting?
				- entrances are mostly turf. they look ok. some are a bit worn. one has a big pokeweed.
		- Make a list of the different areas seen, after answering the above questions
			- i did a walkthrough on saturday 14 dec 2019 at 10:30am and 12:30pm
	B. Also, write down everything and organize that and the answers to Questions (A) into cohesive sections
	C. Ask Brandon for sample of the weekly reports for this park specifically. It could be a good baseline for what is regularly worked on. Maybe don't look at this until I've made my own list, then compare.
	D. Talk to Brandon and take more notes.

III. Different areas of McCoppin (in approximately clockwise order)
	A. Border and Entrances
		- Borders
			1. Santiago
				- lots of crackweeds in sidewalk, also a few weedy street-tree boxes where there is no longer a street tree lol
			2. 22nd Ave (see (L))
				- lots of crackweeds in sidewalk
			3. Taraval
			4. 24th Ave
				- this has a truck entrance as well (path going to tennis court) with one really terrible looking tree that is clearly suffering from something because it's putting out a ton of suckers and the whole thing looks terrible --REMOVE
				- i have sighted irrigation boxes along 24th
		- Entrances
			1. 22nd Ave & Taraval entrance for truck (behind library)
				- pokeweed --REMOVED
			2. 23rd Ave & Taraval CPA entrance
				- the infamous brown spot has appeared; i threw in some yarrow and erigeron and a bit of mulch to help retain moisture. yarrow is hanging in there.
			3. 24th Ave Restroom entrance
				- turf, fine
			4. 24th Ave Police entrance
				- badly hedged ceanothus, with an Erigeron karv buried in there
			5. 24th Ave & Santiago entrance (windy) (see (I))
			6. 22nd Ave & Santiago Ballfield entrance
				- turf is a bit worn out here; could supplement with some non-turf ground cover
	B. Internal Paths
		- line trim
		- replace DG in some spots
		- TMA the broken asphalt bits of Escallonia path
	C. Front of library
		- features a lot of the same cistus in one bed, then 2 raised bonsai lookin shrub of cistus/arctostaphylos, then some beds that are not related to anything: one has straight feathergrass and weeds, and the other has a Melaleuca(linariifolia?) and Acanthus mollis and yarrow and festuca and some other grass i don't know that isn't the feathergrass
		- need to weed raised beds --upper beds demo'd
		- dead cistus --REMOVED
		- also what's the irrigation here? --ONGOING INVESTIGATON
	D. CPA
		- refresh surrounding Artemisia, fill with some variety of color and shape
		- prune it back maybe? need to research how to care for Artemisia
		- i also need to find out about irrigation --STATION 23
		- somewhere near here is a blob of Acacia and it's looming and it's weird and i have a photo of it
	E. Arbutus lawn
		- there is one dying Arbutus facing Taraval --REMOVE
		- there is about to be a big limb failure on the path going toward tennis court (actually it looks pretty solid but who knows. if i climbed on it, it might break)
		- i sighted a quick coupler
	F. Tennis and BBall court, including the nothingness slope across the path from P. crassifolium slope.
		- that gross ceanothus again. cotoneaster and crocrosmia growing out of ceanothus mounds --REMOVE
		- ehrharta world over here
	G. Restroom and Preschool and Ceanothus ADA path
		- hedges outside bathroom: it will be fun to maintain the shape of these, yay
		- ehrharta world over here, also ceanothus MOUNDS which look terrible and i hate it and it's a waste of real estate
		- also there are baby trees in here which are going to outgrow the space and destroy the pathway with roots... so. yea.
		- preschool has some Salvia microphylla. i would want to repeat this somewhere else, for its color and texture and fragrance. like, maybe in front of restrooms.
	H. Circle seating in honor of Bryan Tuvera the fallen police officer
		- monoculture of a single cistus species hedges that are tall enough to be borderline sketch in low light
		- also has some afterthought Salvia leucantha that could be cool but it's overshadowed (literally) by these cistus hedges
		- cool ginkgos
		- weird grisellinia behind everything in two disconnected hedges (why??)
		- i saw toro heads in the planted area behind/next to benches. also there's like, wannabe turf there. would replace with ground cover. (need to find a good one to compete w ehrharta)
	I. 24th and Santiago windy corner entrance
		- Arbutus was planted here because arbutus is wind tolerant
		- there is one conifer here (chamaecyparis lawsoniana? is that u) that i really like, and then a bunch of monterey cypresses. might need to be lifted; but might not. not blocking anything. depends if i want to plant beneath them.
		- there is ivy that i should get rid of before it becomes a problem. it is eating a bunch of hebe
		- also there's a fallen log that is hosting some cape ivy.
		- the turf, even though it's ornamental turf, looks nice, especially with the low shrub border and the monterey cypresses being like, the threshold of the entrance
	J. Pittosporum crassifolium slope along ball field (L shaped until Escallonia path)
		- cape ivy is starting to show up; should get a jump on this while it's small
	K. Baseball field
		- needs sandbags for the left side of the backstop (going into Escallonia path). there's a wattle right now but it's not enough.
		- does field need more windblock? maybe. we'll see. --YES. ADD TREES
	L. 22nd Ave
		1. sidewalk side
			- acacia and acacia suckers. --REMOVE
			- someone has put in a few little oaks
			- there is a very windblown Dodonea(?)
			- gets shaded by eucalyptus in the area past the backstop
		2. ballfield side
			- raised bed; could host some prostrate plants. i see no irrigation at the moment. i see some yarrow remnants.
	M. Eucalyptus grove south of ball field (from Escallonia path)
		- ?!?!?!?! i have no ideas for this. it's a eucalyptus grove
		- there's a eucalyptus at the junction of path and i hate it because it is looming over the path
		- i have an idea now. plant redwoods to be the successor to the euc. idk if they can make it. we'll see.
	N. Escallonia path (not the path itself; that falls under Internal Paths (B))
		- there are these rectangular prisms of ivy, which are actually escallonia that the ivy has covered. for starters, i want to REMOVE the ivy and see if the escallonia can come back.
		- not a huge fan of escallonia in general (kind of a dark/dank vibe) but if it can survive with eucalyptus, then go 4 it. --REDUCE HEIGHT OF ESCALLONIA
	O. Back of library
		- the benches along this path face the back of library and it's weird as hell because? what?? why would i want to sit there and watch people inside the library?!
		- there's turf here but what? why?
		- there's also a weirdly round-shaped conifer just, along the path? and ? why
		- and two Acacia baileyana, one of which isn't doing so hot, further down this path
		- i just want some sort of screen between this seating area and the library, cuz it's weird. would put in some sort of path-border-planting but that doesn't seem prudent at this moment because of all the other, more easily tacklable areas.
		- this is where they do movie screenings

IV. Initial hopes and dreams (to be refined and modified with time and increased familiarity and irrigation constraints)
	A Entrance 6. 22nd Ave & Santiago Ballfield entrance
		- add groundcover turf-replacement. depends on irrigation.
		- trees and small ground cover tests have been added in little mulch islands. i will continue to use this as groundcover test, and expand if results are successful.
	C. Front of library
		- i want to make the raised beds more cohesive
		- currently there's cistus in a uniform color, and i want to change it up by adding different cistus, or getting that variegated cistus (looks like someone tried but the variegated cistus got covered by the regular one)
		- since the other beds have some grasses, i'd like to continue that, but with one or two types of grasses, preferably in a yellow-green/medium-green color (lomandra? NOT fescue)
		- also why are the shrubs (some of the cistus has been pruned to look like it is a small multitrunk tree) in some of these raised beds so tall. why would i want tall things in a raised bed. it's already raised. this is an entrance pathway. keep it low.
	D. CPA
		- the current color palette is a very muted silver-blue, from the artemisia and adenanthos.
		- i would like to incorporate more color to this, because it might be fun for children?
			- i am not yet sure if i want to keep the palette very refined, and just add burgundy
				- cordyline, cotinus, anigozanthos
			- or should i make it pop with different flower colors and kinda make it a color vomit
				- coreopsis, cistus, echinacea, leucanthemum, tagetes, gazania, gaillardia, calendula (just some colorful stuff off the top of my head; would rethink this) (or a ton of asteraceae stuff? depends on water)
			- bottom line: it's boring. i think children like to be surrounded by color, in an overwhelming way that most adults do not want
	G. Restroom and Preschool and Ceanothus ADA path
		- so boring
		- needa change up the shape a bit. too much of the same mounding shape. maybe introduce some monocot-shapes (tall stalks/leaves for structure). i want to use sisrynchium striatum somewhere haha
		- also, wanna decrease the height cuz this is a large (LARGE) area and we could definitely have layers. and maybe stuff that grows closer to the ground could be better for ehrharta control
		- agastache, shorter salvias (the little blue one i forgot the name)
	H. Circle seating
		- boring. we can do better. i really want to redo this because 1) it's one of the only seating spots in this park 2) it's a memorial spot so it should be extra nice 3) it could be extra nice so i'm gonna make it extra nice
		- i want to know if cornus capitata would work here. i think it would be a nice nod to bryan tuvera, for the white flowers
		- need to do further research to complement the ginkgos, which are nice and thriving and in time, will be beautiful and tall and standing over everything (but also deciduous)
	I. 24th and Santiago windy corner entrance
		- i'm inspired by that single conifer and i want this to be a conifer grove sorta thing. would be so sick, especially since the path slopes downward? imagine the leafdrop of redwoods or pines. might also help with the eroding DG path. or it might be slippery and deadly. will keep pondering this idea.
		- also want some low shade shrubs here. i'm trying to deviate from clivia miniata because it's so dark and solemn, but that could be suitable. depends how it holds up to wind.
		- could Chamaecyparis obtusa work here. i'm thinkin the golden one, cuz brightness.
		- i also needa think like, what goes with Arbutus, cuz they already here
	J. Pittosporum crassifolium slope
		- my dream is to make this shaded/protected spot into a visual waterfall by planting ferns and Acorus and Acer palmatum. how awesome would it be if Acer palmatum leaves were sprinkled amongst the ferns and Acorus texture. *w*o*w*
		- realistically, i gotta find out about the irrigation --THERE'S NO IRRIGATION HERE LOL
	L. 22nd Ave
		1. sidewalk side
			- i would definitely like to flood this with oaks, because it could be totally beautiful. also i'm not concerned about leafdrop wrt the ballfield cuz the wind would blow it onto 22nd Ave instead (lol)
			- could later add some douglas irises; that would be nice?
		2. ballfield side
			- yarrow and other experimental ground covers and wildflowers

V. Realistic maintenance plan
	- remove all the "REMOVE" tags
	- line trim all pathways
	- weed all beds
	- ask Brandon
	non-maintenance things imma try to do if Brandon approves:
		- plant oaks along 22nd Ave --DONE
		- fill in some turf with groundcovers; discuss what ground covers are good

VI. Notes:
	- First week:
		- shift in priorities. i think my first minor project will be the preschool / where i've decided to base myself. my first major project will be library cuz it's a visible atrocity.
			- minor project: weed out bed; mulch it, order plants, plant plants. ETA: 3 weeks from start and planning to finish. flex time on this. can weed and mulch and then order plants.			
			- major project: weed out bed and mulch it. that's it. don't do this until design is complete. 
				- start thinking about it after xmas, make a plan, confirm plan with brandon after new year's. order plants. start weeding approx a month from now, 1 week demo and install.
					- the demo took 2 weeks and now i'm stuck on irrigation. it's april.
			- background project: get oaks in the ground along 22nd ave. order oaks by the end of this week. i've already talked to a hundred people about his. i need to log onto nima. --DONE
		- line trim and edge all paths --DONE
		- start pulling plantain from everywhere. make divot-mix and apply to plaintain holes
			- use the plaintain tool (ask Brandon) --YEP
			- NEVER STOP WEEDING - focus on mallow
		- pick up all trash all the time --YEP
		- blow paths and bench areas! --YEP
		- set up shed --DONE
		- irrigation audit, draw a map, make notes. there are definitely leaks. i saw them.

	- Shed:
		- hang up a calendar --DONE
		- hang up a clipboard with like, a laminated thing that i can use as a whiteboard --REAL WHITEBOARD IS PRESENT
		- make use of filing cabinet (?) --DONE
		- make a vision board (LOL) by cutting out pictures and colors and whatever

	- Misc Thoughts:
		- 22nd Ave could be a cool *natives* corner. ie beneath the oaks, i'll shove some arcto and ceanothus... but this creates hideyholes. hmmMMM. maybe stick to herbaceous stuff. no shrubs. --ARCTO IS PLANTED
