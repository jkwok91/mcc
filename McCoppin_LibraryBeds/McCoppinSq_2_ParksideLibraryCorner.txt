McCoppin Sq
- Parkside Library raised beds

I. Research Analysis
	- Planning Objectives:
		- renovate beds at the entrance of Parkside Library
		- create more inviting and appealing entrance, using plants that are low-maintenance and low-water

II. Site Analysis
	- Located at the corner of 22nd Ave and Taraval
	- These beds line the ADA ramp and define the entrance of the library. They are also lining the sidewalk on Taraval, and adjacent to the crosswalk. It is a highly visible corner.
	- South-facing
	- Exposure: full sun
	- Irrigation present
	- Wind: none
	- Pests: vetch

III. Description
	- There are 7 beds, all of which border the ADA ramp.
		- A: 94" deep X 204" wide
		- B: 94" deep X 424" wide
		- C: 94" deep X 344" wide
		- D: 48" deep X 126" wide
		- E: 83" deep on left, 141" deep on right X 643" wide
		- F: 51" deep X 372" wide
		- G: 40" deep X 81" wide
	- Beds A-F are all raised beds, with a 11.5" wide border. The heights of the beds vary.
	- Bed G is bounded by the same 11.5" border on three sides, but is at sidewalk level.
	- Currently there are Cistus, Arctostaphylos, feathergrass(?), Zantedeschia, Achillea, one Melaleuca linariifolia(?), Acanthus, two Festuca, and lots of weeds.
	- There is also bicycle parking between the sidewalk and Bed E.
	- There are stairs to the left of Beds D and E. The front door entrance to the library is left of A.

IV. Users
	- This area is used by library patrons, adults and children alike. The ADA ramp is used by parents with strollers. as well as people entering from 22nd Ave.
	- Sometimes people will sit on the wall of the raised bed.

V. Development Concept
	- I have chosen the theme *enlightenment* which is very cheesy, but it seems appropriate given that this is a library. Also I like the wordplay, and want to incorporate a gradient-effect of color to match the vertical movement of the stairs/ramp, with the colors getting lighter as they move higher.
	- I also want to keep the plants mostly low in Beds F, C, and D. G will most likely be a singular shrub, just to fill the space and cover the wall that borders it. I will have layers in the other beds. Beds A, and B will just have two layers, and E will have more than two. The reason I want taller shrubs in Beds A, and B is to insulate the building, and in E is so the wall is filled in and disguised, for aesthetics. D could also feature something prostrate, so that it can spill over the wall into E.
	- Rough planting idea/shape:
		- A: closest to the entrance, and low to the ground. Also has the roof partially over it.
			- Tall shrub in the back to brighten up this corner
			- Shorter shrub in the front to bring the plants up to knee-level and kinda continue the ramp path all the way to the door
			- Pairings:
				- Artemisia Powis Castle + Salvia apiana + Epilobium canum
				- Westringia (variegated) + 
				- Loropetalum chinense (white/green one) + 
				- Coleonema pulchellum (the neon yellow one)
		- B: along the top of the ramp, alongside building
			- Tall shrub in the back to brighten
			- Shorter shrubs in front
			- Maybe do a semi-circle / wave / diagonal arrangement (not just horizontal) to create interest as you walk along path
			- Pairings: repeat something from Bed A, plus something variegated and shorter
				- Atriplex + society garlic
				- [Tall shrub] + Lomandra
		- C: along the building. maybe two short layers would be nice here
			- Shorter shrub in the back
			- Even shorter grass/perennial in front
		- D: right at the top of the stairs
			- soft perennials, flowering, to greet you as you approach the top of stairs
			- a lighter green / medium green foliage
		- E: largest bed
			- at least three different things. end with something creeping at the bottom? something darker green
		- F: narrow bed closest to the corner, currently housing a Melaleuca(?) tree. looks... not the best
			- this should definitely be the lowest of all the beds
			- short perennials and ground cover only. darker in color than the top beds
		- G: singular shrub could fit here; or vertical monocot texture
