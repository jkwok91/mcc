McCoppin Sq
- Above Shed

I. Research Analysis
	- Planning Objectives:
		- remove dead stuff and replace with alive stuff

II. Site Analysis
	- Located above my shed, in a bed surrounded by a metal gate
	- Slightly sloped, off the path curving up to circle seating
	- There is a large pine and lots of needle drop
	- South-facing
	- Exposure: full sun
	- Irrigation ?
	- Wind: none
	- Pests: ehrharta

III. Description
	- Currently there is a large pine, and two coffeeberry.
	- Pine needle drop helps mulch, but ehrharta is coming through.
	- Also a million little lupine have seeded from the previous lupine parents
	
IV. Users
	- This area is used by no one.
	- This area is seen by people walking on the path, and me. Also, preschool admin, maybe.

V. Development Concept
	- This area should be a lush display of native shrubs. It should be an attraction for park patrons walking down the path. It should also signal the transition from the "native area" into the preschool/athletic courts.

VI. Planning
	- There are already two thriving coffeeberry, and I will continue this theme of natives with more coffeeberry (Frangula californica), and disperse snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus) amongst them because it will provide visual interest. Also, it may attract birds?
	- I want to disguise the fence a little bit and also add a showstopper of blooms, so I'm going to get Philadelphus lewisii. Bonus it is fragrant.
	- I will also sheetmulch this area to keep the ehrharta at bay, until the shrubs grow in enough to shade it out.
	- And on top of that I will add some Fragaria vesca and maybe also Achillea millefolium. Palette will be white and green.

VII. Plants
	- Philadelphus lewisii
	- Frangula californica
	- Symphoricarpos albus
	- Fragaria vesca
	- Achillea millefolium
	- Lupinus sp. I suppose
	- Salvia uliginosa?? because they didn't have symphoricarpos
