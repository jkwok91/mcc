McCoppin Sq
- 24th & Santiago entrance

I. Research Analysis
	- renovate the 24th and Santiago corner entrance of McCoppin
		- unearth a group of ivy- and blackberry-covered Hebe shrubs
	- make this entrance more attractive and leverage the views afforded by the elevation
	- secondary goal: transform the region behind the Hebe shrubs into a seating spot and viewing area for baseball and views

II. Site Analysis
	- Located at the corner of 24th and Santiago
	- Turf-surrounded. This small group of shrubs borders the stand of Cupressus macrocarpa lining the path into the park, on the eastern side of the path. This extends into a overlook spot because it is situated on a small hill.
	- Many commuters use this entrance to walk through the park to the L train
	- North-facing
	- Exposure: half full sun, half part shade (shaded by Cupressus macrocarpa)
	- Irrigation present (for turf)
	- Wind is present
	- Pests: EHRHARTA. blackberry. ivy. sometimes gophers but none at the moment.

III. Description
	- The group of shrubs that is currently covered in ivy and blackberry measures 192' all the way around. It is 69' from the entrance of the path. It is 87' horizontal. It is 6-9' wide at various points. These dimensions are approximate and will change as I am planning to expand the planted area a bit.
	- The trees present are: Cupressus macrocarpa and Arbutus marina.

IV. Users
	- This area is seen by anyone driving on Santiago, and also by commuters who go toward the L train, as well as high school kids who come up the path to go to Lincoln High School.
	- Potentially, this area can be used as seating for baseball games. I would like to turn it into a nice hangout spot. I am confident it won't get too secluded as it is right at the street entrance and there is frequent police vehicle activity all around this corner (thank you, police).

V. Development Concept
	- To make the view from the entrance more inviting, I would like to add some plants to accompany the existing Hebe.
		- As this site can sometimes get shaded, I wanted to introduce some brightness through the usage of variegated foliage, as well as bright flowers (white or yellow)
	- I would also like to define the planted area better by using mulch (wood chips), and start laying out some ground cover that could coexist with the surrounding turf.
	- Some plant thoughts:
		- Cistus (optional; just want to fill in the gaps in the Hebe)
			- white or yellow flowers
		- Hebe (existing)
		- One of these:
			- Pieris japonica (variegated) - matches the Arbutus flower because they are both Ericaceae
			- Tulbaghia violacea 'Silver Lace' - variegated, low
			- Agapanthus 'Tinkerbell' - variegated, visual interest when blooming
			- Hebe speciosa 'Variegata' - matches the existing Hebe but variegated
			- there's something variegated in the AIDS grove along the stairs that i have to go and check because i forgot what it was but that could be good as well
		- Ground cover / low shrubs in the front:
			- Ajuga reptans - matches the purple/dark colors of the existing Hebe
			- Agastache?
			- Prunella
			- Parahebe (white) - this can be cut back every year to be short. has nice tiny white flowers
